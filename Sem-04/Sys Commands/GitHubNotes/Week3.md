## Week 3 Notes

### Combining Commands and Files
* Executing Multiple Commands
  - `command1; command2; command3;`
    - Each command will be executed one after the other.
  - `command1 && command2`
    - command2 will be executed only if command 1 succeeds
    - If the return code is 0 it is true and if it is greater than 0 it is false
    - `ls && date -Q && wc -l /etc/profile` will display the dir listing followed by error that -Q is invalid; wc is not executed.
  - `command1 || command2`
    - command2 will not be executed if command1 succeeds
    - `ls /blah || date` will display current date after "No such file or directory"
    - `ls || date` will display just the directory listing
    - command2 is like a Plan B if command1 doesn't succeed.
  - Example `ls /blah ; date ; wc -l /etc/profile ;`
  - If we use parenthesis ie `(ls /blah ; date ; wc -l /etc/profile ;)` the command gets executed in a subshell and is returned back to the shell we are using.
  - We can use `echo $BASH_SUBSHELL` to return an integer which tells us at what level of execution we are.
    - `(echo $BASH_SUBSHELL)` will report a value of 1 
    - `(ls; (date; echo $BASH_SUBSHELL))` will report a value of 2
  - Launching too many subshells could be expensive computationally.
* File Descriptors
  - Every command in linux has 3 file descriptors - `stdin` (0) , `stdout` (1), `stderr` (2).
    - `stdin` is a pointer to a stream that is coming from the keyboard or use input
    - `stdout` or `stderr` usually points to the screen where the display or output is made.
    - the three pointers are looking at only the stream of characters.
    - they can be directed to a file or a command, or the default behaviour can be left as it is.
  - Combining a command and a file
    - `command > file1` 
      - `stdout` is redirected to `file1`
      - `file1` will be created if it does not exist
      - if `file1` exists, its contents will be overwritten
      - example : `ls -1 /usr/bin > file1` - displays no output on the screen because there is no error
      - `ls -1 /blah > file1` - displays an error. file1 is overwritten and is now 0 Bytes.
      - `hwinfo > hwinfo.txt`
      - trying this command in a folder where there is no w permissions will generate an error
      - The `cat` command tries to read from the provided file name if not given it tries to read from stdin (keyboard)
        - `cat > file1` will allow you to type content. The feature could be used to create text files on the command line. You can come out using the `Ctrl`+`D` option.
        - `cat file1` displays the content of `file1`
        - `cat` takes input from the keyboard and displays it on the screen (line by line; when you press enter) - Finish by pressing `Ctrl`+`D` to signify end of file.
    - `command >> file1` 
      - contents will be appended to file1
      - new file1 will be created if it does not exist.
      - Example : `date >> file2 ; wc -l /etc/profile >> file2 ; file /usr/bin/znew >> file2 ;`
      - `cat >> file1` to append text to a file from command line. Come out using `Ctrl` + `D`

### Redirections
* combining command and file (continued ..)
  - (contd..)
    - `command 2> file1`
      - redirects `stderr` to `file1`
      - `file1`, if it exists, will be overwritten.
      - `file1` will be created if it does not exist.
      - Example `ls $HOME /blah 2> error.txt`
    - `command > file1 2> file2`
      - `stdout` is redirected to `file1`
      - `stderr` is redirected to `file2`
      - Contents of file1 and file2 will be overwritten.
      - The output is in one file and the errors are in another file.
      - Example : `ls $HOME /blah > output.txt 2> error.txt`
      - `ls -R /etc > output.txt 2> error.txt` - permission related errors in error.txt
    - `command < file1`
      - `stdin` is redirected - a command expecting input from the keyboard could take the input from a file.
      - Example : `wc /etc/profile` behaves similar to `wc < /etc/profile`
    - `command > file1 2>&1`
      - command output will be redirected to `file1`
      - `2>` indicates `stderr` and that is being redirected to `&1` (first stream) which is `stdout`
      - contents of `file1` will be overwritten
      - Example : `ls $ HOME /blah > file1` output alone is sent to file1. Error on screen
      - Example : `ls $ HOME /blah > file1 2>&1` output and error is sent to file1.
    - `command1 | command2` Pipe
      - `stdout` output of command 1 is sent to `stdin` of command2 as input
      - Example `ls /usr/bin | wc -l`
    - `command1 | command2 > file1`
      - command1 and command2 are combined and the `stdout` of command2 is sent to `file1`. Errors are still shown on the screen.
      - Example `ls /usr/bin | wc -l > file1` - file1 has the number of lines counted by wc 
    - `command > file1 2> /dev/null`
      - `/dev/null` file - A sink for output to be discarded. Like a "black hole"
      - We normally don't do anything with the `/dev` folder as there are sensitive system files there.
      - If you are confident that the script is running well and you do not want to display any error on the screen, you can redirect the `stderr` to `/dev/null` 
      - `stderr` is redirected to `/dev/null`
      - Example : `ls $HOME /blah > file1 2> /dev/null`
      - Example : `ls -R /etc > file1 2> /dev/null` - file1 contains the output except errors
    - `command1 | tee file1`
      - Used in sitiations where you want to have a copy of the output in a file as well as on the screen.
      - The `tee` command reads from `stdin` and writes to `stdout` and file/s.
      - Example : `ls $HOME | tee file1` also `ls $HOME | tee file1 file2` for creating multiple copies
      - `diff file1 file2` comapares files line by line
        - no output if the files are identical 
      - Example : `ls $HOME /blah | tee file1 file2 | wc -l` - Here  `tee` keeps copy of output in a file and also sends output to `wc -l` for further processing.
      - Example : `ls $HOME /blah 2> /dev/null | tee file1 file2 | wc -l` to supress errors. Note location of `2>` is since the error is generated there.

### Shell Variables - Part 1

* Creation, inspection, modification, lists
* Creating a variable
  - `myvar="value string"`
    - `myvar` can't start with a number, but you can mix alphanumeric and `_`
    - No space around the `=`
    - `"value string"` is the number,string or `command`. Output of a command can be assigned to myvar by enclosing the command in back-ticks.
* Exporting a variable
  - `export myvar="value string"` or
  - `myvar="value string" ; export myvar`
  - This makes the value of the variable available to a shell that is spawned by the current shell.
* Using variable values
  - `echo $myvar`
  - `echo ${myvar}`
    - can manipulate the value of the variable by inserting some commands within the braces.
  - `echo "${myvar}_something"` 
* Removing a variable
  - `unset myvar`
  - Removing value of a variable `myvar=`
* Test is a variable is set
  - `[[ -v myvar ]] ; echo $? `
    - 0 : success (variable myvar is set)
    - 1 : failure (variable myvar is not set)
  - `[[ -z ${myvar+x} ]] ; echo $?`  (the `x` can be any string)
    - 0 : success (variable myvar is not set)  
    - 1 : failure (variable myvar is set)
* Substitute default value
  - If the variable `myvar` is not set, use "default" as its default value
  - `echo ${myvar:-"default"}`
    - if `myvar` is set display its value
    - else display "default"
* Set default value
  - If the variable `myvar` is not set then set "default" as its value 
  - `echo ${myvar:="default"}`
    - if `myvar` is set display its value
    - else set "default" as its value and display its new value
* Reset value if variable is set
  - If the variable `myvar` is set, then set "default" as its value
  - `echo ${myvar:+"default"}`
    - if `myvar` is set, then set "default" as its value and display the new value
    - else display null 
* List of variable names
  - `echo ${!H*}`
    - displays the list of names of shell variables that start with H
* Length of string value
  - `echo ${#myvar}`
    - Display length of the string value of the variable `myvar`
    - if `myvar` is not set then display 0
* Slice of a string value
  - `echo ${myvar:5:4}` (5 is the offset and 4 is the slice length)
    - Display 4 characters of the string value of the variable `myvar` after skipping first 5 characters.
  - if the slice length is larget than the length of the string then only what is available in the string will be displayed.
  - the offset can also be negative. However you need to provide a *space* after the *:* to avoid confusion with the earlier usage of the `:-` symbol. The offset would come from the right hand side of the string.
* Remove matching pattern
  - `echo ${myvar#pattern}` - matches once
  - `echo ${myvar##pattern}` - matches maximum possible
  - Whatever is matching the pattern will be removed and the rest of it will be displayed on the screen.
* Keep matching pattern
  - `echo ${myvar%pattern}` - matches once
  - `echo ${myvar%%pattern}` - matches maximum possible
* Replace matching pattern
  - `echo ${myvar/pattern/string}` - match once and replace with string
  - `echo ${myvar//pattern/string}` - match max possible and replace with string
* Replace matching pattern by location
  - `echo ${myvar/#pattern/string}` - match at begining and replace with string
  - `echo ${myvar/%pattern/string}` - match at the end and replace with string
* Changing case
  - `echo ${myvar,}` - Change the first character to lower case.
  - `echo ${myvar,,}` - Change all characters to lower case.
  - `echo ${myvar^}` - Change first character to uppercase
  - `echo ${myvar^^}` - Change all characters to upper case
  - The original value of the variable is not changed. Only the display will be modified as the trigger commands are within braces.
* Restricting value types
  - `declare -i myvar` - only integers assigned 
  - `declare -l myvar` - Only lower case chars assigned
  - `declare -u myvar` - Only upper case chars assigned
  - `declare -r myvar` - Variable is read only
  - Once a variable is set as read only you may have to restart the bash to be able to set it 
* Removing restrictions
  - `declare +i myvar` - integer restriction removed 
  - `declare +l myvar` - lower case chars restriction removed
  - `declare +u myvar` - upper case chars restriction removed
  - `declare +r myvar` - *Can't do once it is read-only*
* Indexed arrays
  - `declare -a arr`
    - Declare `arr` as an indexed array
  - `$arr[0]=”value”`
    - Set value of element with index 0 in the array
  - `echo ${arr[0]}`
    - Value of element with index 0 in the array
  - `echo ${#arr[@]}`
    - Number of elements in the array. The `@` symbol is a wild character to run through all the elements in the array
  - `echo ${!arr[@]}`
    - Display all indices used
  - `echo ${arr[@]}`
    - Display values of all elements of the array
  - `unset ‘arr[2]’`
    - Delete element with index 2 in the array
  - `arr+=(“value”)`
    - Append an element with a value to the end of the array
* Associative arrays
  - `declare -A hash`
    - declare `hash` as an associative array
  - `$hash[“a”]=”value”`
    - set the value of element with index a in the array
  - `echo ${hash[“a”]}`
    - value of element with index a in the array
  - `echo ${#hash[@]}`
    - number of elements in the array
  - `echo ${!hash[@]}`
    - display all indices used
  - `echo ${hash[@]}`
    - display values of all elements of the array
  - `unset ‘hash[“a”]’`
    - delete an element with index a in the array
  - Can do everything in the indexed array except append because there is nothing called the end of the array as there is no sequence for the elements of a hash
* Examples
  - `true` always returns exit code 0
  - `false` always returns exit code 1 (Check with `echo $?`)
  - To check whether a variable is present
    - `[[ -v myvar ]] ; echo $?` returns 1 if the variable is not present in the memory
    - `[[ -z ${myvar+x} ]] ; echo $? ` returns 0 if variable is not present and 1 if it is present. `x` is a string that will be used as a replacement if the variable was not present.
  - Use of Braces
    - `myvar=FileName`
    - `echo $myvar`
    - `echo "$myvar.txt"` prints FileName.txt
    - `echo "$myvar_txt"` does not print anything as the variable `myvar_txt` does not exist
    - `echo "${myvar}_txt"` prints Filename_txt 
    - Braces are useful in stating clearly the name of the variable.
    - Can also be used outside quotes `echo ${myvar}`
  - Does the variable we have created get passed on to the shell or any other program created within the shell
    - `myvar=3.14 ; echo $myvar`
    - `bash` one more level of bash
    - `ps --forest` to show that we are one level below
    - `echo $myvar` not present
    - Use `export myvar=3.14` to ensure this variable is available to all spawned sub shells.
    - Change value of variable within the child shell
    - modification of value is not reflected in the value of the variable in the parent shell
    - even if you do export of the variable within the child shell it will not change the value within the parent shell.
  - Use of back-ticks
    - `` mydate=`date` `` value of mydate will be output of date.
    - `` mydate=`echo Sunday that is today` ; echo $mydate ``
  - Manipulations for variables within the shell environment
    - We would like to have echo display a default value if variable is not available
    - `` echo ${myvar:-hello} `` the `-` indicates if the value is not present what is the display value
    - `` echo ${myvar:-"myvar is not set"} ``
    - Set the value if it was not set already
    - `` echo ${myvar:=hello} `` if absent / not set then set it to the value after `=`
    - If it is present it will not change
    - `` echo ${myvar:?"myvar is not set"} `` displays a little more information and a debug message. `bash: myvar: myvar is not set`
    - Unset the value of a variable using `unset myvar`
    - ``echo ${myvar:+HELLO}`` displays the message if the variable is present
  - Inspecting all the variables in the shell environment
    - `printenv`
    - `env`
    - `echo ${!H*}` displays the names of variables begining with 'H' - `!` indicates names of the variables instead of value.
  - Counting characters
    - `` mydate=`date` `` stores the output of the `date` command in `mydate`
    - `echo ${#mydate}` prints the length of the value present in mydate.
    - length of a non-existing variable is zero
  - Features of using colon : within braces {}
    - Extracting part of a string from the value of a particular variable.
      - `echo ${mydate:6:10}`
      - `echo ${myvar:3:3}` will print `def` for `myvar=abcdefg` ie: 3 characters after the offset (position 3)
    - Using negative offset
      - `echo ${myvar: -3:3}` and `echo ${myvar: -3:4}` will print `efg` for `myvar=abcdefg`
        - note `-` is to be preceeded with a blank to avoid confusion
        - asking for more characters, will print just what is available
      - `echo ${myvar: -3:2}` will print `ef` for `myvar=abcdefg`
    - Extracting a portion of the date
      - Output of `date` is `Tuesday 25 January 2022 09:10:20 PM IST`
      - Output of `date +"%d %B %Y"` is `25 January 2022`
      - if `` mydate=`date` `` then `echo ${mydate:8:16}` will also print `25 January 2022`
    - Extracting patterns from a string
      - `myvar=filename.txt.jpg`
      - `echo ${myvar#*.}` minimal matching displays `txt.jpg`
      - `myvar=filename.somethingelse.jpeg`
      - `echo ${myvar##*.}` maximal matching displays `jpeg`
      - `echo ${myvar%*.}` displays filename.somethingelse
        - the `%` is used to indicate what has not been matched. (minimal)
      - `echo ${myvar%%*.}` displays filename
        - the `%` is used to indicate what has not been matched. (maximal)
      - Can be combined `echo ${myvar%%.*}.${myvar##*.}` to get `filename.jpeg`
     - Replacing what has been matched
      - Pattern matching in Linux usually goes with a pair of forward slashes.
      - Convert all `e` to `E` in a string
        - `echo ${myvar/e/E}` replaces only the first occurance of `e`
        - `echo ${myvar//e/E}` replaces all occurances of `e`
      - Replace characters at the begining of a string
        - `echo ${myvar/#f/F}` replaces the occurance of `f` in the begining of the string with `F`. The `#` indicates the begining of the string
      - Replace characters at the end of a string
        - `echo ${myvar/%g/G}` replaces the occurance of `g` at the end of the string with `G`. The `%` indicates the end of the string.
      - Replace jpeg with jpg, only if it is at the end of a string
        - `echo ${myvar/%jpeg/jpg}`
     - Modifying and storing it in a variable
        - `` myvar1=`echo ${myvar//jpeg/jpg}` ``
     - Generic command to remove day from date
        - `echo ${mydate#*day}`
     - Upper case to lower case and vice-versa
        - `echo ${mydate,}` changes first character to lowercase
        - `echo ${mydate,,}` converts all characters to lowercase
        - `echo ${mydate^}` changes first character to uppercase
        - `echo ${mydate^^}` changes all characters to uppercase
     - Restricting values that can be assigned to shell variables using `declare`
        - `declare` is a shell builtin
        - `+` to **unset** a restriction and `-` to **set** it  (Note : counterintutuve )
        - `-a` for indexed arrays (need not be ordered indexes)
        - `-A` for associative arrays (dictionaries)
        - `-i` for integers
        - `-u` for uppercase conversion on assignment
        - Integer restriction
            - `declare -i mynum`
            - `mynum=10` will assign 10 to mynum
            - `mynum=hello` will assign 0 to mynum
        - lowercase restriciton
            - `declare -l myvar`
            - `myvar=hello` assigns hello to myvar
            - `myvar=BELLOW` converts BELLOW to lowercase and assigns it to myvar.
        - removing a restriction
            - `declare +l myvar`
            - the value is still contained after removing the restriction but you can now store upper case characters as well
        - declaring a read-only variable
            -  `declare -r myvar`
            -  once a variable has been set as read only, you cannot change its value and you cannot remove the read-only restriction using `+r`
            -  `declare +r myvar` gives the error `bash: declare: myvar: readonly variable`
      - Arrays
        - `declare -a arr`
        - `arr[0]=Sunday`
        - `arr[1]=Monday`
        - `echo ${arr[0]}`
        - `echo ${arr[1]}` 
        - `echo ${#arr[@]}` gives number of elements in the array
        - `echo ${arr[@]}` displays all values
        - `echo ${!arr[@]}` displays the indices`
        - You can have any index without filling up intermediate indices. Indices are not necessarily contiguous.
        - `arr[100]=Friday` is also valid
        - Removing an element from an array = `unset 'arr[100]'`
        - Appending to an array `arr+=(Tuesday)`
        - Populating an array in one go `arr=(Sunday Monday Tuesday)` . The indices are sequential
      - Associative Arrays / Hashes
        - `declare -A hash`
        - `hash[0]="Amal"`
        - `hash["mm12b001"]="Charlie"`
        - `echo ${!hash[@]}` to get indices
        - `echo ${hash["mm12b001"]}`
      - File names in a shell variable 
        - ``myfiles=(`ls`) ``
        - `echo ${myfiles[@]}`
