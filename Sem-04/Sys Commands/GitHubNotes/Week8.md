###### Packages to install

* `clinfo`
* `coreutils`
* `dmidecode`
* `fdisk`
* `hardinfo`
* `hdparm`
* `hwinfo`
  - Will probe hardware and show output on the screen. Information about PCI, partitions, keyboard, tablet, earphones etc..
* `lshw`
  - List hardware. Output is in various sections. You can choose a particular section eg : `lshw -c display` or `lshw -c processor` or `lshw -c memory`

  - `lsblk -o NAME,SIZE` gives information about the number of block devices that are available.
  - `lspci` gives the list of PCI devices connected to the computer using the PCI bus.
  - `free` gives details about the amount of memory used. It is a practice to have double the size of the memory as swap
  - `sudo dmidecode --type memory` gives information about the memory and modules.
  - `hardinfo` is a GUI utility
  - `clinfo` gives information about the graphics card. 
  - `upower -e` to know about the battery status. This will give a list.Choose the one that says battery and execute `upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0` for example.
  - `sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sda` runs diagnostics on the ssd or hdd. Timing cached reads and buffered disk reads.
  - `iostat -dx /dev/sdb` gives information about speeds of various disks.
  - `ifconfig` is a network utility that gives information about ethernet / loopback / wifi adapter.

#### Prompt strings

* Context for prompt strings
  - `bash`,`dash`, `zsh`, `ksh`, `csh`
  - `python`
  - `octave` - Mathlab compatible numerical package
  - `gnuplot` - Plotting tool
  - `sage` - symbolic cumputing package. Perhaps better than Mathematica
 
* bash prompts
  - PS1 : primary prompt string : `$`
  - PS2 : secondary prompt for multi-line input : `>`
  - PS3 : prompt string in select loops : `#?`
  - PS4 : prompt srting for execution trace : `+`
Explanation: There are 4 bash prompts that are configured. What we see is normally the primary prompt when we open the shell. PS2 is shown when a command is incomplete. PS3 is shown when we run a bash script in a select loop. PS4 is shown when every command that is executed is displayed on the screen - when we use the option `set -x`
* Escape sequences

| -  | Description  |
|---|---|
|	`\A`	|	Current time in 24-hour as hh:mm	|
|	`\u`	|	Current user’s username	|
|	`\d`	|	Date in “weekday month day” format	|
|	`\w`	|	Current directory	|
|	`\h`	|	Hostname upto first period	|
|	`\W`	|	Basename of current directory	|
|	`\H`	|	Complete hostname	|
|	`\#`	|	Current command number	|
|	`\s`	|	Name of the shell	|
|	`\$`	|	If uid is 0, # else $	|
|	`\t`	|	Current time in 24-hour as hh:mm:ss	|
|	`\@`	|	Current time in 12-hour a.m/p.m	|
|	`\T`	|	Current time in 12-hour as hh:mm:ss	|
|	`\\`	|	A literal \ character	|

`\u@\h:\w\$` - This is the default value of PS1. Username @ machine name : current dir $ if user is not superuser

To change what is displayed in the prompt string.

* Python command line
  - ps1 and ps2 are defined in the module sys
  - Change `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2` if needed
  - Override `__str__` method to have dynamic prompt
`>>>` Default python command prompt

Demo
- `echo $PS1` - gives `\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$`
- It can be changed `PS1="\u@\h:\w\$ "` . The color will be lost from above prompt string.
- If you do `source .bashrc` you get back the prompt after messing up the prompt string.
- `less .bashrc` to see where it is defined.
- `echo $PS3` doesn't display anything.
- `select x in alpha beta gamma; do echo $x; done` displays PS3
- In octave `x=[1:1:100]` creates array
- In SageMath `plot(sin(x),x,0,2*pi)`

#### Important Utilities

* `find` – locating files and processing them
* `tar`, `gzip` etc – packaging collections of files
* `make` – conditional actions

##### find
* `find [pathnames] [conditions]`

| Condition  | Description  |
|---|---|
|	`-name`	|	pattern to match filenames	|
|	`-type`	|	File type code eg., c for character file, d for directory, l for symbolic	link etc.,|
|	`-atime`	|	Files accessed +n (more than n), -n (less than n) days ago	|
|	`-ctime`	|	File changed +n (more than n), -n (less than n) days ago	|
|	`-regex`	|	Regular expression for pattern of filenames. Combine with -regextype posix-basic, posix-egrep etc.,	|
|	`-exec`	|	Command to run using { } as place holder for filename	|
|	`-print`	|	Print the full path name of matching files	|

* Examples
  - Find
    - `find $HOME -print | wc -l` will print the number of files in the home directory
    - `find $HOME -mtime -2 -print` prints files modified in the last 2 days
    - `find . -mtime -2 -print` prints files modified in the last 2 says in the current working directory
    - `find /usr -type d -name 'man*' -print` directories begining with the word man in /usr directory
    - `find . -size +10M -print` finds files that are more than 10 MB
    - `find . -size +10M -print -exec ls -lsh {} \;` every file that is greater than 10 MB will be inserted in the curly braces. The output will be file name followed by long listing.
    - `find . -name '*.jpg' -exec -ls -sh {} \;` lists all the jpeg files and their size
  - Compression
    - `cp -r /var/log logfiles` To illustrate compression capability get a copy of the log folders
    - `du -sh` shows the size it occupies
    - `ls -lR` displays recursively
    - `tar -cvf logfiles.tar logfiles/` bundles all the files in the directory as logfiles.tar
    - Compress it using `gzip logfiles.tar` 
    - `bzip2 logfiles.tar` shrinks it better but takes some more time
    - `bzip2 -d logfiles.tar.bz2` unzipping the files
    - `compress logfiles.tar` is very fast but compression is not much
    - For a directory that has lot of subdirectories and lot of small files, it is a good idea to package it as a tar file
    - `rm -rf logfiles` to remove the original logfiles directory
    - `uncompress logfiles.tar.Z` unzips the tar
    - `tar -xvf logfiles.tar` gives back the directory
  - Make
    - `make.file` is given below
      
      ```shell
      BACKUPDIR=/home/username/backup
      DATESTAMP:=$(shell date+"%Y-%m-%d %G.%M")
      TARBALL=backup_$(DATESTAMP).tar
      backup: file1 file2
              @echo "Backing up file1 file2 to $(DATESTAMP)"
              tar -cvf $(TARBALL) file1 file2
              @ls -l $(TARBALL)
              mv $(TARBALL) $(BACKUPDIR)
       ```
     - The `:` infront of `=` in the `DATESTAMP` line indicates one-time substitution.
     - `make -f make.file backup`
     - The action is performed only if one of the dependencies has changed. It will get executed again only if file1 or file 2 has changed.
     - ANy maintenence activity can be taken up as a make file command.

##### file packaging

* Deep file hierarchies
* Large number of tiny files
* `tar` : collect a file hierarchy into a single file
* `gzip` : compress a file
* Applications: backup, file sharing, reduce disc
utilization
Explanations:
- Sometimes when there are several small files in a hierarchy structure, the files may occupy the minimum block size so there is a wastage of space. In such situations doing a `tar` will save space.
##### Possibilities

* `tar`, `zip`
* compress (ncompress), gzip (ncompress), bzip2 (bzip2), xz (xz-utils), 7z (p7zip-full)
* Tarballs like bundle.tgz for package + compress
* Time & memory required to shrink / expand versus size ratio
* Portability
* Unique names using timestamp, process ID etc., for backup tarballs
Explanation :
- Plain text or ASCII files can be compressed to a very good ratio (almost 1:10) if the file contains repeting patterns.
- For more efficiency, first zip and then make a tar. Zipping the files while adding it to tar - .tgz file format combines tar and gzip together.
- The deciscion on which method to use is taken based on time required, space occupied etc..

##### make

* `make -f make.file`
```
# comments
TMP_FILES = *.o *.aux
.PHONY : clean
target : prerequisites
recipe $(OPTION_NAME)
clean:
rm -f $(TMP_FILES)
```

#### Network & ssh
###### Accessing remote machines on command line

* IPv4 address range
  - Localhost
    - `127.0.0.0/8`
  - Private network
    - `Class A : 10.0.0.0/8` - 16,777,216
    - `Class B : 172.16.0.0/12` - 1,048,,576
    - `Class C : 192.168.0.0/16` - 65,536
  - Public network
* Explanations
  - Interfaces between Private and Public network is a gateway
  - Local host address is the way by which the system can refer to itself. 
  - The number after the slash indicates how many IP addresses are possible.
  - Class A : The three parts following 10 can be any number between 0 and 255. 2^24-2=16,777,216. This is useful for a large organisation
  - You can create orivate networks within private networks upto 3 levels
* Ways to gain remote access
  - VPN access
  - ssh tunneling 
    - secure shell tunneling
  - Remote desktop : x2go, rdp, pcoip,
    - rdp is popular among Windows machine
    - pcoip with VMWare
  - Desktop over browser: Apache Guacomole
  - Commercial, over internet : Teamviewer, AnyDesk,Zoho assist, ...

* Firewall
  - Ports open on my machine
  - Ports needed to be accessed on remote machine
  - Network routing over the port
  - Firewall controls at each hop

* Protecting a server
  - Server with a public service > Web Application Filter > Network Firewall > Anonymous users

* SELinux
  - Security Enhanced Linux mode available on Ubuntu too, apart from server grade flavors like CentOS, Fedora, RHEL, SuSE Linux etc.,
  - Additional layer of access control on files to services
    - A layer beyond file permissions.
  - Role Based Access Control
  - Process sandboxing, least privilege access for subjects
    - Every process will have restriction of reading the memory locations of other processes
  - Check using `ls -lZ` and `ps -eZ`
  - RBAC items: user `(unconfined_u)`, role `(object_r)`, type `(user_home_t)`, level `(s0)`
    - Role Based Access Control
  - Modes: `disabled`, `enforcing`, `permissive`
  - Tools: `semanage`, `restorecon`
  - SELinux is recommended for all publicly visible servers

* Network tools

| Tool  | Description  |
|---|---|
|	`ping`	|	To see if the remote machine is up	|
|	`traceroute`	|	Diagnostics the hop timings to the remote machine	|
|	`nslookup`	|	Ask for conversion of IP address to name	|
|	`dig`	|	DNS lookup utility	|

* High Performance Computing
  - Look at www.top500.org for statistics
    - All 500 HPC machines are GNU Linux based.
  - Accessing a remote HPC machine is usually over SSH
  - Long duration jobs are submitted to a job scheduler for execution
  - Raw data if large needs to be processed remotely before being transferred to your machine (network charges? bandwidth?)
  - Comfort with command line is a must
* Demo
  - `ifconfig` shows a Class A IP range network within the campus
  - `nslookup www.iitm.ac.in` shows it is connected to `waf6.iitm.ac.in` web application filter.
  - `dig -x 142.250.206.164`
  - `aqua.iitm.ac.in` HPC cluster is not visible from the internet.
  - `qstats` is used to get job status
  - `netstat` to display active connections.

#### Automating scripts
###### Scheduled, recurring, automatic execution of scripts
* `cron`
  - Service to run scripts automatically at scheduled times
  - Tools: `at`, `crontab`, `anacron`, `logrotate`
  - Script locations:
    - `/etc/crontab`  
    - `/etc/cron.d`
    - `/etc/cron.hourly`
    - `/etc/cron.daily`
    - `/etc/cron.weekly`
    - `/etc/cron.monthly`

```
Example of job definition:
.---------------- minute (0 - 59)
|  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
|  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
|  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
|  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
|  |  |  |  |
*  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
```

* Job definition
  - `5 2 * * 1-5 root cd /home/scripts/backup && ./mkbackup.sh`
    - `5` minute (0-59)
    - `2` hour (0-23)
    - `*` day of the month (1-31)
    - `*` month (1-12) or jan, feb, ...
    - `1-5` day of week (0-6) or sun,mon, ...
    - `root` user-name
    - `cd /home/scripts/backup` command
  - The above command runs mkbackup.sh as root every working day at 02:05 AM
* Demonstration
  - The first time crontab is used you have to select the default editor
  - crontab is in `etc` directory
  - `anacron` is run by the System administrator
  - `cron.daily` is a folder in `etc` that displays daily tasks. Similarly `cron.hourly`,`cron.monthly`,`cron.weekly`
  - By placing a script in any of these directories you can make it run at the specified schedule
  - By running `crontab -e` you can execute a specific script at a time. Customize timely running of scripts.

* Startup scripts
  - Startup scripts: `/etc/init/`, `/etc/init.d/`
  - Runlevel scripts:

| Level  | Location  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|	`0`	|	`/etc/rc0.d/`	|	Shutdown and power off	|
|	`1`	|	`/etc/rc1.d/`	|	Single user mode	|
|	`2`	|	`/etc/rc2.d/`	|	Non GUI multi-user mode w/o networking	|
|	`3`	|	`/etc/rc3.d/`	|	Non GUI multi-user mode with networking	|
|	`4`	|	`/etc/rc4.d/`	|	Non GUI multi-user mode for special purposes	|
|	`5`	|	`/etc/rc5.d/`	|	GUI multi-user mode with networking	|
|	`6`	|	`/etc/rc6.d/`	|	Shutdown and reboot	|

#### Managing Storage
###### LVM & RAID

* LVM
  - Logical Volume Management
  - Pooling multiple storage devices as a single logical volume
  - `lvm2 tools` : create and manage virtual block devices from physical devices
  - Suppose you need a very large partition but there is no HDD available of that size, you can define a logical volume that spans over multiple HDDs.
  - Logical Volumes are mounted by the GNU Linux OS, which are mapped over multiple physical disks.
* RAID
  - Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks
  - Distributing data over multiple discs for redundancy / speed / increased capacity
  - Raid Controller : software or hardware
* RAID modes
  - usable capacity < actual capacity

| RAID Mode  | Min drives  | Description  | Comments  |
|---|---|---|---|
|	RAID 0	|	2	|	Striping	|	Speed up	|
|	RAID 1	|	2	|	Mirroring	|	Read is n times faster, n-1 drive failures tolerated	|
|	RAID 5	|	3	|	Block-level striping with distributed parity	|	1 drive failure tolerated, Read is n times faster, write is n-1 times faster	|
|	RAID 6	|	4	|	Block-level striping with dual distributed parity	|	2 drive failures tolerated, read is n times faster, write is n-2 times faster	|

* Explanation
  - RAID 0 - You are using 2 disks as 1. Half of one file is stored on 2 disks. Doubles speed of access of a file. Write Speed is 2x and Read Speed is 2x for 2 disks. If there are n disks in RAID 0 equivalent storage is size of minimum disk * n.
  - RAID 1 - Any piece of the file is written to both the disks. Reading is 2x but writing is n-1. People tend to use RAID 1 for OS alone.
  - RAID 5 - When you have more than 3 disks. Data is written to more than one disk. If one fails nothing is lost.
  - RAID 6 - Parity over 2 disks. If 2 disks fail you still have all your data.
  - Most of the hardware supprts hot-swap. 
  - Useable capacity is less than the actual capacity
  - For storage people use RAID 5 or RAID 6.
* Demo
  - `df -h` to check system storage
  - WHich RAID configuration to use to improve read performance and sustain at least one disk failure without losing data ? RAID 4, RAID 6.
